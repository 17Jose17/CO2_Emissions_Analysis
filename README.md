# CO2 Emissions Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository focuses on analyzing CO2 emission trends across various countries. The analysis includes handling missing data, performing correlation studies, and visualizing results using predictive models and interactive maps.

### Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning:** Imputation of missing CO2 emission data.
- **Trend Analysis:** Identification of CO2 emission patterns across countries.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Statistical exploration of relationships between CO2 emissions, population, and GDP.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Application of predictive models to study trends and correlations.
- **Visualization:** Interactive maps and graphical representations of results.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Imputation:
Imputed missing values in CO2 emission data using statistical methods to ensure consistency and accuracy.

### 2. Trend Analysis:
Analyzed historical data to identify patterns and trends in CO2 emissions across different countries and regions.

### 3. Correlation and Predictive Modeling:
Explored the relationship between CO2 emissions, population, and GDP using:
- Correlation coefficients
- Linear regression models
- Other predictive modeling techniques

### 4. Visualization:
Created interactive maps and graphs to effectively communicate findings.
