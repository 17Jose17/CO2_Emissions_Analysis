# CO₂ Emissions Analysis

## Overview
The **CO₂ Emissions Analysis** project focuses on understanding, cleaning, and predicting CO₂ emissions trends by country. The workflow includes data cleaning, grouping by country, imputing missing values, and predicting emissions for the following year.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed inconsistencies and handled missing data to ensure dataset quality.
- **Data Grouping**: Organized the data by country for better insights and regional analysis.
- **Imputation**: Applied techniques to fill in missing values for more accurate predictions.
- **Prediction**: Used statistical or machine learning models to forecast CO₂ emissions for the next year.

## Dataset
- **Fields**:
  - Country
  - Year
  - CO₂ Emissions
  - Other relevant environmental indicators

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `sklearn` for predictive modeling
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed duplicate entries.
   - Handled outliers and missing values.
2. **Grouping by Country**:
   - Aggregated data by country for easier regional comparisons.
3. **Imputation**:
   - Filled missing values using statistical methods (e.g., mean, median, or regression).
4. **Prediction**:
   - Trained models to predict CO₂ emissions for the upcoming year.
   - Validated predictions with historical data.
